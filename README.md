# 🎓 1337 School Projects (C Language)

This repository contains the projects I completed at **1337 Coding School**,
all implemented strictly in the **C programming language**.

These projects focus on **low-level programming**, memory management,
algorithmic thinking, and Unix system concepts, following the 1337 / 42 coding standards.

## 🛠️ Language & Tools
- Language: **C**
- Compilation: `gcc`
- Standards: **Norminette**
- Environment: Unix / Linux

## 📦 Project Categories

### 🟢 Fundamentals (C Basics & Algorithms)
- **libft** – Custom C standard library
- **get_next_line** – Reading from file descriptors
- **push_swap** – Sorting algorithms using stacks

### 🔵 Advanced (System Programming in C)
- **minishell** – Unix shell implementation
- **philosophers** – Multithreading & synchronization

Each folder contains a detailed README explaining:
- Project goal
- C concepts used
- What I learned
- Technical challenges

⚠️ Note: All projects are written in pure C, without using external libraries
(except those explicitly allowed by the subject).
